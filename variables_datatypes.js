console.log("Hello Naitik Mehta");
// var ,let and const
// use camel case naming

var fullName = "Naitik Mehta";
console.log(fullName);//string

var isLoggedIn = true;//boolean

var loggedCount = 34;//number

var paymentMode;//undefined datatype
paymentMode = "Credit card";

// difference between var and let is that var can be redeclared but let cannot be redeclared because it is block scoped that means it is only available in the block in which it is declared
